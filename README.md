This is the working respository for my little YouTube series titled "Learn Angular 2 in 21 Days (for Java Devs)".

There is a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLix-OafSjpFmq9K8eItC6bFSgz-732Rkn) for all the episodes as they are developed.

Or just checkout the entire [Fresh Bytecode Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChOgnDhsjo_8UGhPQH8tH1w) to see new content in context.

## Angular CLI Generation

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.10.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
